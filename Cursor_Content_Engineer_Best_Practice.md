## 🔄 Cursor Workflow Steps (Content Engineer Method)

1. **Create Project Folder**  
   - Set up `src/`, `docs/`, and initialize Git

2. **Write PRD in `PRD.md`**  
   - Define goals, users, requirements

3. **Generate `ACTIONS.md`**  
   - Extract tasks from PRD for each sprint

4. **Use Cursor Prompting**  
   - Write clear prompts in Cursor terminal or comments
   - Let AI generate initial code, tests, or docs

5. **Review and Edit in Cursor**  
   - Use diff tools to verify changes
   - Use `.cursor/` history to rollback or compare

6. **Document Everything**
   - Update `README.md` and `WORKFLOW.md` regularly
   - Use `PROMPT_ENGINEERING.md` to record prompt patterns

7. **Commit Early, Commit Often**
   - Push changes to GitHub with meaningful commit messages

8. **Iterate**
   - Refactor code and regenerate documentation as needed

---

## ✅ Tips

- Use comment-based prompts: `# cursor: prompt -> "generate a function that..."`
- Keep your `PRD.md` and `ACTIONS.md` in sync.
- Use Cursor’s sidebar to manage `todo:` comments.
- Always run & test code before committing.
